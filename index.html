                            The Aquaman actor was introducing the Best Sound award with Josh Brolin, when he
                            intentionally let out a belch into the microphone while announcing Dune as the winner at the
                            ceremony on Sunday (27 March).
                            <br>
                            After the moment occurred, many rushed to Twitter to ask if what they thought they heard
                            did, in fact, happen.
                            <br>
                            “Did Jason Momoa just burp into the mic right before announcing the sound Oscar,” one
                            twitter user asked, with another saying: “Did Jason Momoa just burp on command at the
                            Oscars?”
                            <br>
                            One viewer branded him “the hero we all need”.

                            Almost Got The Boot From Upcoming Aquaman Film — It has been reported that, due to lack of
                            chemistry with star Jason Momoa, Amber Heard was almost replaced on the upcoming film,
                            Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

                            by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and
                            debuted in the comic book Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18,
                            1938).[1] Superman has been adapted to a number of other media which includes radio serials,
                            novels, movies, television shows and theatre.

                            Superman was born on the fictional planet Krypton and was named Kal-El. As a baby, his
                            parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a
                            natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of
                            Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him
                            Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and
                            impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of
                            humanity, and he decided to fight crime.</p>

                            developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled

                            to be charged using his mystic lantern. "Green Lantern" was re-imagined in the Silver Age as
                            an intergalactic peacekeeping force called the Green Lantern Corps, with test pilot Hal
                            Jordan serving as the new Green Lantern. <br> The Guardians of the Universe on Oa give these
                            Lanterns rings, again powered by a battery, but also requiring strong willpower to be
                            wielded, and sent them to patrol all 3600 sectors of the known universe. Jordan became a
                            founding member of the Justice League on Earth-One, and Scott was a member of the Justice
                            Society on Earth-Two. Their timelines were merged during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and
                            it was explained that Scott's magic ring taps into the Starheart. There have been several
                            other human Green Lanterns of Sector 2814.

                            Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall. It stars Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman,
                            who sets out to lead the underwater kingdom of Atlantis and stop his half-brother, King Orm,
                            from uniting the seven underwater kingdoms to destroy the surface world. Amber Heard, Willem
                            Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Temuera Morrison, and Nicole
                            Kidman appear in supporting roles.

                            Development began in 2004 but did not gain traction until Man of Steel was released in 2013.
                            In August 2014, Beall and Kurt Johnstad were hired to write competing scripts. Wan signed on
                            as director in April 2015, and in July 2016, the film moved forward with Beall's screenplay.
                            The main cast was confirmed through 2016 and early 2017. Principal photography began in
                            Australia in May 2017, taking place at Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast,
                            Queensland, Australia, with additional production teams in Canada, Italy and Morocco.
                            Filming concluded the following October. Several vendors provided visual effects, ranging
                            from high-detail hair simulations to the creation of CGI animals and locations.
